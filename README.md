# CSC-360-Programs
Programming assignments from the UVic CSC 360 (Operating Systems) course in Summer 2020.

A1: Implementation of a simple Unix shell. Specifically, the shell includes the functionality to receive user input and execute arbitrary commands, change directories, execute commands in the background, list and kill the background commands, and suspend and resume the background commands at the user's discretion.

A2: Simulation of an automated control system for a single lane train bridge using pthread mutexes. Trains approach the bridge from two directions, and only one train can be on the bridge at a given time.

A3: Implementation of a basic file system similar to Microsoft's FAT File System. Specifically, the file system includes the functionality to read and display information stored in the superblock, read and display the contents of the root directory, copy a file from the file system to the current Linux/Unix directory, and copy a file from the current Linux/Unix directory to the file system.
